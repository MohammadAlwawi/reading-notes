## What is Markdown?
**Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or ***
# Examples

# Structured documents
### Headers & Quotes
Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. 

Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.
###Text
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown using ** ** and - - 
####Images
If you want to embed images, this is how you do it
##Lists
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
