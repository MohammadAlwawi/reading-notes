#  Operators and Loops
USING COMPARISON OPERATORS At the most basic level, you can evaluate two variables using a comparison operator to return a t rue or f al se value. In this example, a user is taking a test, and the script tells the user whether they have passed this round of the test. The example starts by setting two variables:

1. pass to hold the pass mark
2. score to hold the users score
 ## COMPARI NG TWO EXPRESSIONS

In this example, there are two rounds to the test and the code will check if the user has achieved a new high score, beating the previous record. The script starts by storing the userâ€™s scores for each round in variables. Then the highest scores for each round are stored in two more variables. USI NG DO WHILE LOOPS The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met. If you take a look at the condition, it is checking that the value of the variable called i is less than 1, but that variable has already been set to a value of 1. Therefore, in this example the result is that the 5 times table is written out once, even though the counter is not less than 1. Some people like to write while on a separate line from the closing curly brace before it.
