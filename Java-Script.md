# JAVASCRIPT
## Javascript:
**_javascript_** you allows you to make web pages more interactive. Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful. The examples below rely on the ability to: Access the content of the page Modify the content of the page Program rules or instructions the browser can follow React to events triggered by the user or browser.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

**FROM STEPS TO CODE**: Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow. Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the: • Vocabulary: The words that computers understand • Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow

You need to learn to “think” like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them. A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

EXPRESSIONS An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions. 1 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 2 EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

OPERATORS : Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 
**ARITHMETI C OPERATORS** : JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class.
## EXPRESSIONS
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE
## OPERATORS
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values
## STRING OPERATOR
There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.
It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
